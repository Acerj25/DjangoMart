# CS-Projects

This repository is to serve as a collection of all the major non-academic cs projects I have endeavored to complete in my free time to gain more exposure to various technologies and sharpen my coding expertise. So far, this repository holds 
an Online Marketplace in Django, a Portfolio Website and a Weather App, both using HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJs and ThreeJs. In the future, I plan to add projects in other fields of computer science to enrich my learning in areas such as AI, machine learning,
cybersecurity, and more. I am excited for the journey ahead and I hope to polish my skills further to create something that can improve people's lives all around the world.
